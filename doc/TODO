Things to complete for 0.1.0:
  * Stop using 'getinfo network-status' to get a list of servers. Instead, we
    should be using 'getinfo ns/all' (Tor >= 0.1.2.3-alpha).
  * There is a ticket about not being able to save config changes when an alternate
    torrc is specified. Needs to be verified and fixed. (Ticket #159)
  * We shoud close any logs that have 'stdout' or 'stderr' as the target after
    we connect to Tor's control port, but pass command line arguments to Tor
    to tell it to log to stdout and stderr initially, in case it dies before
    we can connect to its control port. This way, if Vidalia freezes, Tor
    won't freeze.
  * Our GeoIP cache should recognize IP addresses on the same subnet.
    (Ticket #154)


Features planned for 0.1.x:
  * GeoIP requests should be encrypted so the exit node does not know what is 
    being requested and cannot muck with the requests or responses.
  * Roger has added some additional events that Vidalia should respond
    to, such as "hey, you're a server now!"
  * Scheduled rate-limiting, so the user can adjust their bandwidth
    limits depending on what time of day it is.
  * An interface for letting the user send arbitrary signals to Tor. The phase
    1 GUI competition judges didn't like the idea, but our users and Roger
    seem to like the idea. Oh what is a Vidalia developer to do?
  * Provide an interface for configuring all torrc options. This might look
    something like a table, populated via "getinfo config/names". (Ticket #76)
  * A web-based interface for viewing the status of Tor from the user's
    browser and possibly configuring Tor, too. (Ticket #42)
  * We should support and use the ControlSocket option whenever possible.


Packaging:
  * Create a Vidalia package for Debian.
  * Make the OSX bundle include Torbutton, too.
  * The general consensus so far has been that Polipo is better/faster than
    Privoxy, so we should start thinking about moving to Polipo. Ideally,
    Vidalia will launch Polipo in the background just like it does Tor so
    the user doesn't have to know that Polipo exists and Windows users don't
    have another icon cluttering their tray.
  * Building a Windows bundle installer is a bit of a pain initially,
    since you have to create a bunch of specifically-named directories and
    copy files from Vidalia's svn directory. Can we make this easier? For
    example, maybe we could make a batch file that takes as arguments paths to
    the Tor, Privoxy, and Vidalia installers, and then produces a completed
    bundle installer.


Localization:
  * Website and wiki. The website shouldn't be too hard since we only have a
    couple pages, but it doesn't look like Trac lends itself to multiple languages
    on the wiki too easily.
  * OS X installer. Is there a standard way OS X handles installer
    translations? I assume we'd mostly just need to translate our little
    VidaliaBundleWelcome.rtf file and maybe a couple strings in the .plist
    files, but how does the user choose which language they want to see?


Miscellaneous Tasks:
  * Work on improving the network map with better graphics, server pinpoints
    that are more visible and clickable, and clickable circuits. Marble might
    be a good start for some of that.
  * When creating the Tor service on Windows, we either should be creating a
    separate user to run the service as (instead of running it as Local
    System), or we should write a patch for Tor to do it (Ticket #174).
  * We should parse the Tor log messages we pipe from stdout and look for
    errors or warnings, so we can give better error messages (e.g., "Hey, you
    probably already have a Tor running without a control port open."). Suggested
    by Karsten Loesing.
  * Improve window transparency support. In particular, figure out how to do the
    following correctly on X11 (from the Qt docs):
      "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite
      extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

      Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11
      specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager
      you are using."
  * Think about smarter ways to handle the GeoIP lookups. Our servers get
    quite a bit of traffic from GeoIP lookups and it would be nice if we could
    cut this back a bit.
  * Get some help from the Sasha and the CMU folks with doing a real user study and
    getting help making our window layouts and text better.
  * Rework src/control/ a bit so it is more modular and can be dropped into
    any other Qt application that wants to talk to Tor.
  * Add a --disable-qsystrayicon autoconf option to build with our own tray
    icon implementation with Qt 4.2, instead of using QSystemTrayIcon.
  * The 'Save' button in the config dialog should be grayed out until the user
    actually changes some settings.
  * We should have a Windows shell script file to build Vidalia, similar to
    our auto* stuff, except the user doesn't need to install Cygwin, MSYS, or
    similar. In practice, this really would just run 'qmake' and 'lrelease'
    for now.
  * We need to come up with a simple set of instructions for Windows users to
    give us helpful information when their Vidalia crashes. The standard Windows
    error messages are not useful, so we need to tell Windows folks how to get
    a backtrace. This may also involve telling them to first download a
    Vidalia binary with debugging symbols before reproducing their crash.
  * If we get rid of Privoxy, it would be good to have a set of tray and dock
    icons for Vidalia that show some sort of activity when the user is
    actively using Tor.


Notes from Roger:
  * It looks like we need to restart Vidalia to get a new language choice to
    take effect. This means restarting my Tor, which will break my current
    Tor activity. I know it's probably a hassle to make it change languages
    without a restart, but it will make our foreign users a lot happier.
  * 17:53 < arma> does vidalia have a fascistfirewall button?
    17:53 < edmanm> it does not. should it?
    17:57 < arma> at some point, it should.
    17:57 < arma> it could also have a http/https proxy box, at some point.
   
    On a similar note:
    22:16 < arma> i am also starting to ponder a new 'settings' window to let
                  people enable fascistfirewall, to let them opt to become a 
                  bridge, and to let them opt to use a bridge.
    22:18 < edmanm> what would we call this new settings page?
    22:20 < arma> i dunno. "Firewall" is my best thought for now.
    22:21 < arma> with a line at the top that has a checkmark for setting
                  fascistfirewall and a textbox to write port numbers;
    22:21 < arma> and the rest of the page is divided into two
                  sections, each with a little checkbox at the top and empty 
                  otherwise,
    22:21 < arma> and the first checkbox is "I want to sign up to be a bridge"
    22:22 < arma> and the second checkbox is "I can't get to the Tor network 
                  directly"
    22:22 < arma> and when you check them they expand to a bunch of other stuff. 
                  like the server checkbox does now.
