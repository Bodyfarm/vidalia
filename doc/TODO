Near-future Goals:
  * Create Vidalia packages for Red Hat and Debian

  
Pie-in-the-sky Goals:
  * Circuit and stream control. "click-click-click, I want that circuit"
  
  * Scheduled rate-limiting, so the user can adjust their bandwidth
    limits depending on what time of day it is.


Miscellaneous Tasks:
  * Improve window transparency support. In particular, figure out how to do the
    following correctly on X11 (from the Qt docs):
      "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite 
      extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

      Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11 
      specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager 
      you are using."

  * Get some help from the Sasha and the CMU folks with doing a real user study and 
    getting help making our window layouts and text better.

  * Find something to replace Trac. Perhaps Bugzilla+Mediawiki or MoinMoin.

  * I'm told our website looks terrible in IE. We should try to fix this.


Notes from Roger:
  * I mentioned today that it would be smart if Vidalia recognized when
    Tor refuses to write its config file because of permissions, and did
    something smarter -- like handling the error and remembering the intended
    changes itself, or like rephrasing the error to give some hints about
    what's going on.

  * I think we mentioned putting the exit policy into the form on the
    "configure server" page, since right now I can't imagine they recognize
    that they have a complex exit policy when in fact the page is blank.
    You can fetch the exit policy from Tor by asking for "getinfo
    exit-policy/default". (You can learn if it's available by getinfo
    info/names, and for Tors where it's not available, it's probably simplest
    to hard-code the current exit policy inside Vidalia.)

  * When I click 'save' in the server configuration page, and it fails, for
    example because "Unacceptable option value", the error message doesn't
    wrap and doesn't have a scrollbar. So I need to make the window bigger
    to see it all. And I'm guessing in some cases I won't realize there's
    more to see.

  * On the 'configure server' window, it says "Only relay traffic between
    other Tor servers (middle-man)". We should move this to the 'Exit 
    Policies' section.

  * For the configure server window, I'm using 1024x768, and it fills my
    screen vertically. Will lower resolutions have problems here?
