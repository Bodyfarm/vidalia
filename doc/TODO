Regarding window transparancy:
    "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite 
    extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

    Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11 
    specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager 
    you are using."

So basically transparancy is not supported on < Win 2000, and we need to figure out
how to detect that atom thing in X11 and respond accordingly.
