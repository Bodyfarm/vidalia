Near-future Goals:
  * Fix the problems with torrc permissions tha result when we start our own
    Tor process (this doesn't really apply to Windows).
  * Figure out what is causing all of these funky problems with random Windows
    applications. If it turns out to be Qt (which is my current guess), we should 
    try to submit a patch to Trolltech.
  * When creating the Tor service on Windows, we either should be creating a
    separate user to run the service as (instead of running it as Local
    System), or we should write a patch for Tor to do it.
  * Create Vidalia packages for Red Hat and Debian
  * Make our ./configure smart enough to determine if the user has a release
    or debug version of Qt and link to the correct one, instead of always just
    assuming the debug library is present. It should also determine whether
    the version of Qt in the user's $PATH is recent enough or not.


Pie-in-the-sky Goals:
  * Scheduled rate-limiting, so the user can adjust their bandwidth
    limits depending on what time of day it is.


Miscellaneous Tasks:
  * Improve window transparency support. In particular, figure out how to do the
    following correctly on X11 (from the Qt docs):
      "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite 
      extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

      Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11 
      specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager 
      you are using."
  
  * Think about smarter ways to handle the GeoIP lookups. Our servers get
    quite a bit of traffic from GeoIP lookups and it would be nice if we could
    cut this back a bit.
  * Get some help from the Sasha and the CMU folks with doing a real user study and 
    getting help making our window layouts and text better.
  * Find something to replace Trac. Perhaps Bugzilla+Mediawiki or MoinMoin.
  * I'm told our website looks terrible in IE. We should try to fix this.


Notes from Roger:
  * I mentioned today that it would be smart if Vidalia recognized when
    Tor refuses to write its config file because of permissions, and did
    something smarter -- like handling the error and remembering the intended
    changes itself, or like rephrasing the error to give some hints about
    what's going on.
  
  * For the configure server window, I'm using 1024x768, and it fills my
    screen vertically. Will lower resolutions have problems here?
