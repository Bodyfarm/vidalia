Things to complete for 0.1.0:
  * When creating the Tor service on Windows, we either should be creating a
    separate user to run the service as (instead of running it as Local
    System), or we should write a patch for Tor to do it (Ticket #174).
  * There is a ticket about not being able to save config changes when an alternate 
    torrc is specified. Needs to be verified and fixed. (Ticket #159)
  * Roger has added some additional events that Vidalia should respond
    to, such as "hey, you're a server now!"
  * Actually do something useful with the AUTHENTICATE command, rather than
    simply sending an empty one.
  * Our GeoIP cache should recognize IP addresses on the same subnet.
    (Ticket #154)
  * GeoIP requests should be compressed and then encrypted so the exit node 
    does not know what is being requested and cannot muck with the requests
    or responses.
  * Add a checkbox for disabling the alpha-blended integrals on the bandwidth
    graph; the extra cpu usage makes some people sad.


Features planned for 0.1.x:
  * Scheduled rate-limiting, so the user can adjust their bandwidth
    limits depending on what time of day it is.
  * An interface for letting the user send arbitrary signals to Tor. The phase
    1 GUI competition judges didn't like the idea, but our users and Roger
    seem to like the idea. Oh what is a Vidalia developer to do?
  * Provide an interface for configuring all torrc options. This might look
    something like a table, populated via "getinfo config/names". (Ticket #76)
  * A web-based interface for viewing the status of Tor from the user's
    browser and possibly configuring Tor, too. (Ticket #42)
  * A window to which Vidalia can log its own debugging information, which 
    would be displayed when Vidalia is started with --debug. This wouldn't
    have to be as fancy as the message log window for Tor messages.


Miscellaneous Tasks:
  * Create a Vidalia package for Debian.
  * Improve window transparency support. In particular, figure out how to do the
    following correctly on X11 (from the Qt docs):
      "This feature is available on Mac OS X, X11 platforms that support the Composite 
      extension, and Windows 2000 and later.

      Note that under X11 you need to have a composite manager running, and the X11 
      specific _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY atom needs to be supported by the window manager 
      you are using."
  
  * Think about smarter ways to handle the GeoIP lookups. Our servers get
    quite a bit of traffic from GeoIP lookups and it would be nice if we could
    cut this back a bit.
  * Get some help from the Sasha and the CMU folks with doing a real user study and 
    getting help making our window layouts and text better.


Localization:
  * Website and wiki. The website shouldn't be too hard since we only have a
    couple pages, but it doesn't look like Trac lends itself to multiple languages 
    on the wiki too easily.
  * OS X installer. Is there a standard way OS X handles installer
    translations? I assume we'd mostly just need to translate our little
    VidaliaBundleWelcome.rtf file and maybe a couple strings in the .plist
    files, but how does the user choose which language they want to see?


Notes from Roger:
  * I mentioned today that it would be smart if Vidalia recognized when
    Tor refuses to write its config file because of permissions, and did
    something smarter -- like handling the error and remembering the intended
    changes itself, or like rephrasing the error to give some hints about
    what's going on.
