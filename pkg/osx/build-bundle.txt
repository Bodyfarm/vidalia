           Building the Vidalia/Tor/Polipo OS X Bundle

Libevent
1. Download and extract the latest libevent source from
   http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

2. Configure libevent with the following:
   ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

3. Build and install libevent as follows:
   make && make install

   You will need to be root to `make install`

  NOTE: If you have previously installed a Libevent that was not configured with
  the options above, you must remove those before building Tor, otherwise Tor
  will link to the wrong Libevent.


Qt
4. Download and extract the open source version of Qt 4.2 or higher from 
   Trolltech at the following address:
   http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac

  Alternatively, download the open source Qt dmg and install.  You can now skip 5
and 6.

5. Configure Qt with the following (OS X 10.4 or later):
  export MACOSX_DEPLOYENT_TARGET=10.4
   ./configure -static -release -universal -fast -no-qt3support \
     -nomake demos -nomake examples -sdk /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/

6. Build and install Qt as follows:
   make && make install
 
 
Polipo
7. Download the OS X Polipo source from:
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/files/polipo/.

7a. Download the Tor modifications to Polipo from:
https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/trunk/contrib/polipo/.  

Alternatively, download a tarball with the Polipo source and Tor
modifications together from:
http://interloper.org/tmp/polipo/polipo-1.0.4-with-tor-mods.tgz

8. Follow the directions to build polipo at
  https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/contrib/polipo/README


Tor
9. Download and extract the latest Tor source from
   https://www.torproject.org/download

   Note the location to which you extract Tor's source, because you will need
   to specify it in Step 12.

10. Configure Tor with the following:
   ./configure --prefix=/Applications/Vidalia.app --bindir=/Applications/Vidalia.app --sysconfdir=/Applications/Vidalia.app

11. Build Tor by running 'make'. You do NOT need to run 'make install'
afterwards.


Vidalia
12. Configure Vidalia with the following:

      export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4
      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake -DOSX_FAT_BINARY=1 \
            -DTOR_SOURCE_DIR=<path-to-tor> \
            -DPOLIPO_SOURCE_DIR=<path-to-polipo> \
            -DTORBUTTON_XPI=<path-torbutton.xpi> ..

13. Run `make dist-osx-bundle` to build Vidalia and package all of the
components (Vidalia, Tor, Polipo and Torbutton) into a single .dmg. The resulting
.dmg will be placed in the 'build' directory created in Step 11.

14. (Optional) Run 'make dist-osx-split-bundle' if you would like to build
the split OS X bundle.

NOTE: Steps 1-6 only need to be done once initially, unless you need to
change the packaged version of Libevent or Qt. Step 7 also only needs to
be done once, unless Polipo ever gets updated. Steps 9-11 need to be
repeated when the bundled version of Tor changes. Steps 12-13 need to be
repeated when the bundled version of Vidalia changes.
