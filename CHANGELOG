0.0.12  01-Jun-2007
  o Added a new "Control Panel" main window that appears when Vidalia first
    starts. This dialog is for people who either aren't trained to look in
    their system tray area for a Vidalia icon, or those who simply do not have
    a system tray area.
  o Added -logfile and -loglevel command-line options that can log useful
    Vidalia debugging messages to a file or to stdout. Hopefully this will
    help make tracking down future Vidalia bugs easier.
  o Add a box to the Advanced settings page to change the IP address on which
    we will try to connect to Tor's control port, instead of always assuming
    127.0.0.1. (Ticket #81)
  o Don't yell at the user if our SAVECONF fails after changing some
    configuration settings; just remember the intended settings and reapply them
    next time Tor runs.
  o Restore a window to its previous state each time it is opened, not just
    the first time after Vidalia is started.
  o Only allow the 'New Identity' button to be clicked once every 60 seconds.
  o Show the number of online servers in the status tip for the server list,
    as well as the total number of servers.
  o Expand filenames that use "~/", "%APPDATA%", or "%PROGRAMFILES%" in either
    the path to Tor's executable or torrc.
  o Fix the message log timestamp format to be "MMM dd hh:mm:ss.zzz", instead
    of "MMM dd hh:mm:ss:zzz".
  o Don't create the help browser window until we actually need it, so we
    don't waste memory on a window the user might never use.
  o Fix a minor bug that's been around since 0.0.1: actually remove objects
    from the list of targets for an event, instead of from a copy of the list.
  o Display command-line options information as a message box so even Win32 
    folks can see it, if they give Vidalia a bogus argument.
  o Revert back to the single uninstaller strategy on Win32, so don't leave
    program groups behind after uninstalling the bundle. (Ticket #237)
  o Start Privoxy minimized if the user selects "Run installed components now"
    after completing the Win32 installer.
  o Don't skip past the Win32 installer results immediately, since there could
    have been errors the user should see.
  o Include a default.action file for Privoxy in the Win32 and OS X bundles 
    with the +limit-connect{1-} fix.
  o Include some more helpful text in the Win32 installer welcome screen and
    category descriptions.
  o Fix the paths to *-spec.txt in the script that builds the OS X bundles.
  o Include Tor_Uninstaller.applescript and uninstall_tor_bundle.sh in the OS
    X bundle. (Ticket #230)
  o Updated Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Polish and Spanish
    translations.
 

0.0.11  07-Feb-2007
  o Fix a race condition that could (and did) cause Vidalia to freeze.
  o RESETCONF all server-related settings when the be-a-server checkbox gets 
    unchecked, not just ORPort and Nickname.
  o Add support for zlib or gzip compressed GeoIP responses. 
  o Handle chunked transfer encodings properly in GeoIP responses.
  o Be a little less eager to send GeoIP requests right away. Now we wait 10
    seconds after adding an address to the queue, or a maximum of 30 seconds,
    before sending the request.
  o Tolerate entries in geoip-cache that have no timestamp. If an entry does
    not have a timestamp, use the current date and time. 
  o Respond to double-clicks on the map. Double left-click zooms in towards
    the mouse pointer and double right-click zooms out.
  o If Vidalia is built with Qt >= 4.2, use the open and closed hand cursors 
    in ZImageView when panning the world map.
  o Qt >= 4.2 handles the sorting in addTopLevelItem() in the server list. We 
    still do the sorted inserts ourselves in older Qts. 
  o Display circuits as a list of server nicknames (like we currently do), but 
    save the original circuit paths (possibly with key IDs for non-Named
    servers) so we don't display the wrong server information when the user 
    selects that circuit.
  o Fix a bug introduced in 0.0.10 that caused a server's little pinpoint on
    the map to not be highlighted green when the server is selected in the
    server list.
  o Update the stream target address on every stream status event, not just
    NEW stream events.
  o Add an EU flag for the server list.
  o Add a "Cancel" button to the message box that asks server operators if
    they want to delay server shutdown or kill Tor right away. (Ticket #222) 
  o Add version information to our compiled Win32 vidalia.exe.
  o Be more tolerant of Win32 people removing the Tor service out from under 
    Vidalia.
  o Explicitly specify the tab order in the bandwidth graph.
  o Fix a bug in parsing Tor's version string when it contains modifiers such
    as '-alpha'.
  o Make Circuit::hops() correctly return an empty QStringList for empty paths,
    instead of a QStringList with one empty QString.
  o Do a better job of detecting Qt 4.2 debug libs on OS X. There were a few 
    necessary non-Qt libs missing from LIBS when we did our AC_TRY_LINK.
  o Add vidalia.spec to our configure.in, so the RPM spec file stays current.
  o Add a Traditional Chinese installer and GUI translation from Cloud.
  o Updated Dutch, Farsi, Polish, Russian, and Simplified Chinese translations.


0.0.10  25-Dec-2006
  o Load NT service functions on demand so we can run on Windows 95/98/ME
    again. (Ticket #211)
  o Add a column to the list of servers in the network map window, with a 
    little flag icon for each server. 
  o If the network map window is not visible, queue all GeoIP requests until
    either the window becomes visible again or the queue contains requests for
    at least one-quarter of all known servers.
  o If we get a valid geoip response telling us the geoip database doesn't
    have a location for the requested IP address, cache that response for one 
    week so we don't keep sending requests that are likely to fail anyway. 
  o Use QSystemTrayIcon when available (except on Mac). If we are using 
    QSystemTrayIcon on systems that support balloon messages, use a balloon to 
    indicate when NEWNYM is successful. We still show a message box when NEWNYM 
    fails. (Ticket #183)
  o Add a graph style dropdown box to the bandwidth graph settings, so you can
    choose between a fancy alpha blended area graph and a faster, simpler line
    graph.
  o Add a button to continue starting Vidalia anyway, even if Vidalia thinks
    there might be another Vidalia process already running. It's possible that a
    previous Vidalia did not exit cleanly and another process ended up with
    the old Vidalia's PID.
  o Add a "Zoom to Circuit" option to the circuit context menu in the network
    map's list of circuits.
  o Add a context menu to the dock icon on OS X. (Ticket #135)
  o If we're building with Qt >= 4.2.0, then use its new saveGeometry() and 
    restoreGeometry() functions to save and restore window size and position. 
    If we're still using an old Qt, make sure the window fits on screen when
    we try to restore it. (Ticket #207)
  o Fix a bug in how the server points were keyed on the network map that
    could cause some circuits to not get drawn. (Ticket #175)
  o Really close the read channel when we want to stop reading from the Tor
    process's stdout. This would sometimes cause duplicate messages in the
    message log if Vidalia was running on a non-English-speaking Windows.
  o Be more correct about what we consider as valid latitudes and longitudes.
  o Give a better error message if we fail to determine what version of Tor's
    control protocol is being spoken.
  o Clarify some labels in the message log settings. (Ticket #203)
  o Settle on a convention of not ending tool tips or status tips with a
    period.
  o Start shipping a geoip-cache file in our Win32 installers so people have
    some initial geographic information, instead of starting out entirely
    empty-handed.
  o Add a Farsi translation.
  o Add a Spanish translation contributed by desolator.
  o Add a Portuguese (Brazilian) translation contributed by Mabat Haram.
  o Add a Simplified Chinese installer translation contributed by omg.
  o Updates to Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, 
    Russian, and Simplified Chinese translations.


0.0.9   05-Nov-2006
  o Added a new, more intuitive interface for setting a server's bandwidth
    rate and exit policies.
  o Improved our ./configure script so it will detect old or non-debug
    versions of Qt and link accordingly.
  o Added support for more easily building Qt as a Universal binary on OS X.
  o Added a right-click option to circuits listed in the network map dialog to 
    close the circuit (Ticket #176).
  o Added a right-click option to servers listed in the network map dialog to 
    zoom in on the server on the map (Ticket #176).
  o Stop using a custom font and just use the platform default on all dialogs.
  o Add "Close Window" shortcuts for Linux (Ctrl+W).
  o Fixed a crash bug that would occur when saving messages in the message 
    log (Ticket #185).
  o Fixed a bug that would cause messages with identical timestamps to not
    get copied to the clipboard (Ticket #190).
  o Ask if the user wants to delay shutting down their server when Vidalia
    exits, to give clients time to find new circuits. We previously only did
    this when the user stopped Tor, but wasn't exiting Vidalia.
  o If Windows is restarting, then don't ask about delaying a server shut
    down; just stop Tor and exit immediately so Windows doesn't yell at us.
  o Detect if Tor was installed as an NT service prior to Vidalia, so we don't
    accidentally remove it.
  o Create a new torrc and specify a control port for the Tor NT service, so 
    it doesn't die when the user tries to start the service and we don't have
    to tell the user to go add a line to their torrc.
  o Fixed a bug that caused Vidalia to crash if it tried to read in a bogus
    geoip-cache file from its data directory (Ticket #184).
  o Refuse to cache information we did not ask for that we received in response 
    to a GeoIP request.
  o Wait no more than ten seconds after queueing a GeoIP request before
    sending it, so requests don't starve if we keep constantly getting new
    descriptors.
  o Ask Tor what its SocksPort and SocksAddress is before building our GeoIP
    request, instead of always assuming Tor is listening on 127.0.0.1:9050.
  o Explicitly specify the sort order for the message log and server list, so
    things aren't backwards when linking with Qt 4.2.x.
  o Add support for translating the Vidalia and Vidalia bundle installers.
  o Start bundling Torbutton with the Vidalia bundle installer.
  o Add a Norwegian (Bokmal) translation contributed by xiando.
  o Updates to the Finnish, French, German, and Polish translations.


0.0.8   03-Oct-2006
  o Vidalia will now attempt to connect to an existing Tor's ControlPort
    before starting its own Tor process. If it finds a Tor with an open
    ControlPort, Vidalia will "attach" to that Tor instead of starting a new
    process.
  o Vidalia now supports running Tor as an NT service on Windows.
  o When Vidalia starts its own Tor process, it will now default to starting it 
    with a "-f ~/.vidalia/torrc", to avoid permissions conflicts when running 
    Tor as a user that does not have write access to the default torrc. The
    torrc used when starting Tor is still configurable.
  o Fix a bug that was causing unexpected behavior with many unrelated Windows
    applications.
  o Do a better job of determining if another Vidalia process is running on
    Windows, to eliminate all the false positives reported.
  o Major performance improvements related to loading the network map.
  o Support receiving server identities in circ events, as well as names, so 
    Vidalia will work with Tor 0.1.2.2-alpha and later.
  o Moved the "New Identity" button to the main popup menu for easier
    access.
  o Vidalia dialogs remember their last size and location when Vidalia exits 
    and restore their size and location the next time Vidalia runs.
  o Vidalia windows now close in response to a Command-W on Mac OS X.
  o Added a "Zoom To Fit" button to the network map, to zoom in on the active
    circuits.
  o Numerous minor aesthetic and usability improvements to many of Vidalia's
    dialogs.
  o Fix a bug that was causing signal conflict warnings on Debian.
  o Fix a crash that would occur when exiting Vidalia after an attempt to
    start Tor with a non-existent executable.
  o Add a Bulgarian translation contributed by kutia0001.
  o Add a Dutch translation contributed by Saedian.
  o Add a Hungarian translation contributed by Tibor Fekete.
  o Add a Polish translation contributed by ZeeWolf.
  o Updates to the Finnish, French, and Russian translations.


0.0.7   07-Jul-2006 
  o Fix a bug that was causing Vidalia to freeze frequently for some people,
    particularly when running at a verbose log level.
  o Fix a bug that would cause Windows Vidalias to not want to start after
    Vidalia had been killed via the Task Manager.
  o Add a French translation contributed by Michel Burkhardt.
  o In the network map, update the displayed uptime by looking at the difference
    between now and the publication time, and add that difference to the published 
    uptime.


0.0.6   23-Jun-2006
  o Fix the network map to properly remove circuits after they are closed.
  o Fix our configure script to properly handle the --prefix option (patch by
    Alexander Wirt).
  o Check if Vidalia is already running when we start. If Vidalia is already
    running, then warn and exit in the second instance.
  o Strip all invalid characters from the server's nickname and make sure the
    user can't enter any.
  o Default to the Tor binary located in the user's $PATH, instead of trying
    to guess directory locations.
  o Add support for adjusting a server's BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst
    values.
  o Store Vidalia's settings in a file, (rather than in the registry on
    Windows), so Vidalia can be more portable. Note that settings aren't
    "imported" from the registry, so 0.0.5 users will have to configure
    their Vidalia settings again.
  o Make the bandwidth graph just a normal window instead of a tool window, so
    it can hide behind other Vidalia windows, if necessary.
  o On OS X, ensure that the About, Configure, and Exit actions get merged
    into the "Vidalia" menu in the default menubar when Vidalia is running in
    a non-English language.
  o Add an Italian translation contributed by Alex Mazzariol.
  o Add a Russian translation contributed by ygrek.
  o Add a manpage for Vidalia contributed by Alexander Wirt.
  
  
0.0.5   02-Jun-2006
  o Make the "Always On Top" property of the bandwidth graph optional.
  o Add a new dialog showing a list of routers that the user's Tor currently
    knows about, as well as the user's current circuits and streams and
    detailed information about individual routers. The circuits and router
    geographic locations are plotted on a world map. Thanks to Christoph
    Sieghart, Michael Zuercher, and Adam Tomjack for help with this feature.
  o Stop automatically scrolling to the newest item added to the message log,
    if the user is looking through their message history.
  o Create a horizontal scrollbar on the message log when an excessively long
    message is logged.
  o Add support for the NEWNYM signal in the form of a "New Identity"
    button, to force Tor to use only clean circuits for new application
    requests.
  o Add a Mac OS X bundle.
  o Add a Finnish translation contributed by DJHasis.
  o Add a German translation contributed by Christoph Sieghart.
  o Fix a bug that caused people running servers to update their public IP
    address too often if they had the "Automatically Update" option checked.


0.0.4   09-May-2006
  o Add a fixed set of Windows .ico files from Dan Christensen. Our
    contributed set in 0.0.3 apparently had a blank image in it that some old
    Windowses would use instead of the icon that actually had an image.
  o Add an option for servers to check periodically to see if their public IP
    address has changed.
  o Give servers the option to shut down after 30 seconds, to give clients
    time to find new circuits, instead of just always killing Tor immediately.
  o Improve GUI responsiveness when waiting for the Tor process to finish
    starting up.
  o Be smarter about guessing the default location of Tor in non-English
    Windowses.

  
0.0.3   13-Apr-2006
  o Fixed a server configuration bug that caused people to not really be a
    middleman node, even though the checkbox told them they were.
  o Fixed a bug in choosing a default language that caused help documents to
    sometimes not appear.
  o Fixed the Win32 bundle installer to not leave 2 files and a registry key 
    laying around after an uninstall. Also give users the option of launching
    Vidalia when the solo installer is finished.
  o Fixed a bug where Vidalia would ignore Windows when asked to shut down
    because the system is restarting.
  o Improved tray icon support on older Windowses. Also started using a new
    set of icons created by Matt Hanson, based on our previous set by Corinna
    Habets.
  o Improved help document accessibility by adding "Help" buttons to many
    dialogs and error message boxes.

  
0.0.2   02-Apr-2006
  o Added an integrated help browser and documentation.
  o Added exit policy configuration support for servers.
  o Added support for language translations and language selection.
  o Added a Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) translation from Wu Xiaoguong.
  o Added support for changing Vidalia's interface style.
  o Aesthetic improvements in many dialogs.

  
0.0.1   28-Feb-2006
  o Initial testing release.
  o Basic features include:
    - Starting/stopping/monitoring Tor
    - Bandwidth graph
    - Message log
    - Basic server configuration
