0.0.6   23-Jun-2006
  o Fix the network map to properly remove circuits after they are closed.
  o Fix our configure script to properly handle the --prefix option (patch by
    Alexander Wirt).
  o Check if Vidalia is already running when we start. If Vidalia is already
    running, then warn and exit in the second instance.
  o Strip all invalid characters from the server's nickname and make sure the
    user can't enter any.
  o Default to the Tor binary located in the user's $PATH, instead of trying
    to guess directory locations.
  o Add support for adjusting a server's BandwidthRate and BandwidthBurst
    values.
  o Store Vidalia's settings in a file, (rather than in the registry on
    Windows), so Vidalia can be more portable. Note that settings aren't
    "imported" from the registry, so 0.0.5 users will have to configure
    their Vidalia settings again.
  o Make the bandwidth graph just a normal window instead of a tool window, so
    it can hide behind other Vidalia windows, if necessary.
  o On OS X, ensure that the About, Configure, and Exit actions get merged
    into the "Vidalia" menu in the default menubar when Vidalia is running in
    a non-English language.
  o Add an Italian translation contributed by Alex Mazzariol.
  o Add a Russian translation contributed by ygrek.
  o Add a manpage for Vidalia contributed by Alexander Wirt.
  
  
0.0.5   02-Jun-2006
  o Make the "Always On Top" property of the bandwidth graph optional.
  o Add a new dialog showing a list of routers that the user's Tor currently
    knows about, as well as the user's current circuits and streams and
    detailed information about individual routers. The circuits and router
    geographic locations are plotted on a world map. Thanks to Christoph
    Sieghart, Michael Zuercher, and Adam Tomjack for help with this feature.
  o Stop automatically scrolling to the newest item added to the message log,
    if the user is looking through their message history.
  o Create a horizontal scrollbar on the message log when an excessively long
    message is logged.
  o Add support for the NEWNYM signal in the form of a "New Identity"
    button, to force Tor to use only clean circuits for new application
    requests.
  o Add a Mac OS X bundle.
  o Add a Finnish translation contributed by DJHasis.
  o Add a German translation contributed by Christoph Sieghart.
  o Fix a bug that caused people running servers to update their public IP
    address too often if they had the "Automatically Update" option checked.


0.0.4   09-May-2006
  o Add a fixed set of Windows .ico files from Dan Christensen. Our
    contributed set in 0.0.3 apparently had a blank image in it that some old
    Windowses would use instead of the icon that actually had an image.
  o Add an option for servers to check periodically to see if their public IP
    address has changed.
  o Give servers the option to shut down after 30 seconds, to give clients
    time to find new circuits, instead of just always killing Tor immediately.
  o Improve GUI responsiveness when waiting for the Tor process to finish
    starting up.
  o Be smarter about guessing the default location of Tor in non-English
    Windowses.

  
0.0.3   13-Apr-2006
  o Fixed a server configuration bug that caused people to not really be a
    middleman node, even though the checkbox told them they were.
  o Fixed a bug in choosing a default language that caused help documents to
    sometimes not appear.
  o Fixed the Win32 bundle installer to not leave 2 files and a registry key 
    laying around after an uninstall. Also give users the option of launching
    Vidalia when the solo installer is finished.
  o Fixed a bug where Vidalia would ignore Windows when asked to shut down
    because the system is restarting.
  o Improved tray icon support on older Windowses. Also started using a new
    set of icons created by Matt Hanson, based on our previous set by Corinna
    Habets.
  o Improved help document accessibility by adding "Help" buttons to many
    dialogs and error message boxes.

  
0.0.2   02-Apr-2006
  o Added an integrated help browser and documentation.
  o Added exit policy configuration support for servers.
  o Added support for language translations and language selection.
  o Added a Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) translation from Wu Xiaoguong.
  o Added support for changing Vidalia's interface style.
  o Aesthetic improvements in many dialogs.

  
0.0.1   28-Feb-2006
  o Initial testing release.
  o Basic features include:
    - Starting/stopping/monitoring Tor
    - Bandwidth graph
    - Message log
    - Basic server configuration
