<h1>Network Viewer</h1>
<hr />

<p>
The network viewer lets you see routers in the Tor network and where
your traffic is going.
</p>


<a name="overview"/>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
When you want to communicate anonymously through Tor (say, connecting to a
website), Tor creates a tunnel, or <i>circuit</i>, of encrypted connections
through a series of routers on the network. Your application's traffic is then
sent as a <i>stream</i> through that circuit. For efficiency, multiple streams
may share the same circuit.
</p>

<a name="netmap"/>
<h3>Network Map</h3>
<p>
The network map consists of a map of the world, with red pinpoints indicating
the geographic location of routers in the Tor network. Green lines are drawn
between routers to indicate the path of circuits that your Tor client has
created through the Tor network.
</p>
<p>
You can zoom in on locations in the map by clicking the <b>Zoom In</b> and
<b>Zoom Out</b> buttons in the toolbar. You can also scroll around on the map
by clicking on the map and then dragging it in whatever direction you would
like to move the map.
</p>
<p>
The geographic location of a Tor router is determined by looking up the IP
address of the router in a GeoIP database, created by MaxMind and located at
geoip.vidalia-project.net.
</p>
<p>
In the middle of the dialog, below the network map, you will see a list of
your current circuits, as well as any application traffic currently on those
circuits. When the network map first loads, you will probably see a connection
to geoip.vidalia-project.net, which occurs when Vidalia is looking up
geographic information for the list of Tor routers. It is important to note
that this request is done through Tor, so your location is not revealed to the
GeoIP server. The results of the lookups will be cached locally in order to
reduce load on Vidalia's GeoIP servers.
</p>


<a name="status"/>
<h3>Router Status</h3>
<p>
On the left side of the network view, you will see a list of routers in the
Tor network. Next to each router is an icon indicating that router's status.
The following table summarizes the possible router status icons:
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-unresponsive.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is offline or simply not responding.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-hibernating.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is <i>hibernating</i>, meaning it is online, but has used up as
    much bandwidth as the operator is willing to allow for a given time
    period.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-none.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online, but has shown only minimal throughput.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-low.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 20 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-med.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 60 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><img src="qrc:/images/icons/node-bw-high.png"/></td>
  <td valign="middle">
    The router is online and has shown a throughput &gt;= 400 KB/s.
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
All bandwidth values are estimates based on the minimum of either 
the maximum bandwidth sustained input or output over any ten second period 
in the past day.
</p>


<a name="details"/>
<h3>Router Details</h3>
<p>
The router details panel at the right side of the screen gives you details
about the router or routers currently selected in the 
<a href="#routerlist">router list</a>. If you have selected a circuit or stream
in the list of your current circuits and streams, this panel will show you
details about each router through which your traffic is currently being
relayed.
</p>
<p>
The fields that you may see in the panel are as follows (<i>Note</i>: not all
of these fields will always be present):
</p>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><b>Location</b></td>
  <td>The geographic location of this Tor router.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>IP Address</b></td>
  <td>IP address at which this Tor router can be reached.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Platform</b></td>
  <td>
    Operating system information and Tor version on which this router is
    currently running.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Contact</b></td>
  <td>
    Contact information for this router's operator, in case there is a
    problem with the router.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Bandwidth</b></td>
  <td>
    Estimated maximum amount of bandwidth that the directory servers have 
    seen this router handle recently.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Uptime</b></td>
  <td>
    Length of time this router has been available, which can be used to help
    estimate this router's stability.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Last Updated</b></td>
  <td>Date this router's information was last updated.</td>
</tr>
</table>
