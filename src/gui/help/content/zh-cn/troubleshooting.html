<h1>问题多多</h1>
<hr />

以下列出了一些常见的问题，包括运行Tor时出现的。如果您的问题没有解答，
请访问我们的网站<i>www.vidalia-project.net</i>，以获得进一步的资讯支持。

<a name="start"/>
<h3>我无法运行Tor</h3>
<p>
最常见的原因是已经有一个Tor进程在运行。请检查您的进程列表，如果找到先前进程，
请将其停止。然后试试再运行Tor。
</p>
<p>
If that did not help, check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor printed any information about errors it encountered
while trying to start.
如果这个办法不管用，请检查 <a href="log.html">消息日志</a>，
查看Tor是否显示了启动时的出错信息。 
</p>

<a name="connect"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Connect to Tor</h3>
<p>
Vidalia manages Tor by communicating with it via Tor's <i>control port</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The most common reason that Vidalia cannot connect to Tor is because Tor
started, but encountered an error and exited immediately. You should
check your <a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if Tor reported any
errors while it started.
</p>
<p>
If Tor is listening on a different port than Vidalia expects, Vidalia will
be unable to connect to Tor. You rarely need to change this setting, but if
there is another service running on your machine that conflicts with Tor's 
control port, you will need to specify a different port. You can change this
setting in Vidalia's <a href="config.html#advanced">advanced configuration
settings</a>.
</p>

<a name="stop"/>
<h3>Vidalia Can't Stop Tor</h3>
<p>
If Vidalia cannot stop Tor, you should check your <a href="log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor reported any errors while trying to exit.
