Vidalia can help you control your Tor process by letting you start and stop
Tor, as well as monitoring Tor's status and letting you know if it exits
unexpectedly.

<h3>Starting and Stopping Tor</h3>

  <li>
    Vidalia's tray icon will change from an onion with a red X to a green
    onion when Tor has started.
  </li>
</ol>
If Vidalia is unable to start Tor, Vidalia will display an error message
telling you what went wrong. You can also look at your
<a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if
Tor printed any more information about what went wrong.

    red X when Tor has stopped.
  </li>
</ol>

telling you what went wrong. You can also look at your
<a href="log.html">message log</a> to see if Tor printed any more

<h3>Monitoring Tor's Status</h3>
<p>
Vidalia tells you about the status of Tor by display an icon in your system
tray or dock area.
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Gray onion w/ red X</i></b>: Tor is stopped.</li>
  <li><b><i>Green onion</i></b>: Tor is currently running.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If Tor exits unexpectedly, Vidalia will change its icon to a gray onion with a
red X and display an error message letting you know what went wrong.
