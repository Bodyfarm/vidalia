<h3>I Can't Start Tor</h3>
<p>
The most common reason that Tor cannot start is because there is already
another Tor process running. Check your list of running process and stop the
previous Tor process, if you find one. Then, try running Tor again.

If that did not help, check your <a href="qrc:/help/en/log.html">message
log</a> to see if Tor printed any information about errors it encountered
while trying to start.
