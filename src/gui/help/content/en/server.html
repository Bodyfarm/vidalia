<h1>Running a Tor Server</h1>
<hr />

The Tor network is made up of volunteers all over the world who donate some of
their spare bandwidth by running a server. Vidalia helps you do your part by
making it easy to set up a server of your own.

<h3>Basic Setup</h3>
<p>
If you decide you want to help the Tor network grow by running a server, you
can follow these steps to get started:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Open the <i>Configuration Dialog</i> by selecting <i>Configure</i> from
    the tray menu or <i>Preferences</i> from your system menubar on Macintosh
    systems.
  </li>
  <li>Select the <i>Server</i> configuration page.</li>
  <li>Check the box labeled <i>Relay traffic for the Tor network</i>.
  <li>Enter the following information:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Nickname</b>:
        The name which your server will be known as on the Tor network. An
        example of a server nickname is "myVidaliaServer".
      </li>
      <li><b>Contact Info</b>:
        Your e-mail address or PGP key. This address will only be used to
        contact you in case there is an important Tor security update or
        something goes wrong with your server.
      </li>
      <li><b>Server Port</b>:
        The port on which your server will listen for traffic from clients or
        other Tor servers.
      </li>
      <li><b>Address</b>:
        Enter an address at which your computer can be reached by other Tor
        servers on the Internet. If you don't know your public IP address, you
        can click on <i>Get Address</i> and Vidalia will contact an external
        site (e.g., <i>http://www.vidalia-project.net/iptest/ip.php</i>) to
        find out what it thinks your public IP address is.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>
    If you would like to mirror Tor's directory of servers for others on the
    network you can check the box labeled <i>Mirror the server directory</i>.
    If you do not have much bandwidth, leave this box unchecked. If you do
    decide to mirror the server directory, make sure the <i>Port</i> is
    different than the <i>Server port</i> you entered above.
  </li>
  <li>
    Traffic exiting the Tor network from your router appears to come from your
    IP address. If you do not want this, then check the box labeled <i>Only
    relay traffic between other Tor servers</i> to act as a <i>middle-man</i>
    node.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Exit Policies</h3>
<p>
Exit policies give you a way to specify what sort of traffic you are willing
to allow exit from your Tor server. Tor uses a default list of exit policies
that restrict services such as mail to prevent spam, or some default file
sharing ports to reduce abuse of the Tor network.
