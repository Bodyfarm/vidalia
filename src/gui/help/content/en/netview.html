<h1>Network Viewer</h1>

<p>
The network viewer lets you see routers in the Tor network and where
your traffic is going.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
When you want to communicate anonymously through Tor (say, connecting to a
website), Tor creates a tunnel, or <i>circuit</i>, of encrypted connections
through a series of routers on the network. Your application's traffic is then
sent as a <i>stream</i> through that circuit. For efficieny, multiple streams
may share the same circuit.
