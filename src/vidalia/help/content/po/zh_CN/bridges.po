"Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from "
"accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor "
"relays. Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are relays that help "
"these censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor relays, "
"bridges are not listed in the same public directories as normal "
"relays. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if your ISP is "
"filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably won't be "
"able to block all the bridges."

"有些因特网服务提供商（ISP们）试着利用封锁已知网桥连接来阻止用户连接到 Tor 网络。网桥中继（或简称<i>网桥</i>）是一种可以帮助这种用户连接到 "
"Tor 网络的中继。不像其他的 Tor 中继，网桥不会和普通中继一样列表于公共目录中。所以它们并没有一个完整的公共列表，即使你的 ISP 过滤所有已知 "
"Tor 中继连接，他们依然可能无法封停所有的网桥。"

"To use private bridges, ask your friends to run Vidalia and Tor in an "
"uncensored area of the Internet, and then click on <i>Help censored "
"users</i> in Vidalia's <a href=\"server.html\">Relay settings page</a>. Then "
"they should privately send you the <i>Bridge address</i> line at the bottom "

"just passes data to and from the Tor network, so it shouldn't expose the "
