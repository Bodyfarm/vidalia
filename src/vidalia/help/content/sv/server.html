<h1>Setting Up a Tor Relay</h1>
<hr />

The Tor network is made up of volunteers all over the world who donate some of
their spare bandwidth by running a Tor relay. Vidalia helps you do your part by
making it easy to set up a relay of your own.

<a name="basic"/>
<h3>Allmänt-inställningar</h3>
<p>
If you decide you want to help the Tor network grow by running a relay, you
can follow these steps to get started:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Open the <i>Configuration Dialog</i> by selecting <i>Settings</i> from
    the tray menu or <i>Preferences</i> from your system menubar on Macintosh
    systems.
  </li>
  <li>Select the <i>Relay</i> configuration page.</li>
  <li>
    Decide whether you want to run a normal Tor relay or a <i>bridge</i>
    relay (Tor 0.2.0.8-alpha or newer). Bridge relays help censored Tor users
    who are blocked from accessing the Tor network directly.
    Check the box labeled <i>Relay traffic for the Tor network</i> if you want
    to run a normal Tor relay or <i>Help censored users reach the Tor network</i>
    if you want to run a bridge relay.
  </li>
  <li>Enter the following information:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Nickname</b>:
        The name which your relay will be known as on the Tor network. An
        example of a relay nickname is "MyVidaliaRelay".
      </li>
      <li><b>Contact Info</b>:
        Your e-mail address. This address will only be used to
        contact you in case there is an important Tor security update or
        something goes wrong with your relay. You might also include your PGP
        or GPG key ID and fingerprint.
      </li>
      <li><b>Relay Port</b>:
        The port on which your relay will listen for traffic from clients or
        other Tor relays.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>
    If you would like to mirror Tor's directory of relays for others on the
    network you can check the box labeled <i>Mirror the Relay Directory</i>.
    If you do not have much bandwidth, uncheck this box. If you do
    decide to mirror the relay directory, make sure the <i>Directory Port</i> is
    different than the <i>Relay port</i> you entered above. Bridge relays
    <i>must</i> mirror the relay directory.
  </li>
</ol>

<a name="bandwidth"/>
<h3>Bandbreddsbegränsningar</h3>
<p>
Running a Tor relay can consume a large amount of bandwidth; however, Tor
allows you to limit the amount of bandwidth that you are willing to contribute
to the Tor network. You can run a relay, while still keeping your network
connection usable for your own use.
</p>
<p>
You should select the option in the dropdown box that best matches your
connection speed. If you select <i>Custom</i>, you will be able to specify
your own limits.
</p>
<h4>Custom Limits</h4>
<p>
The <i>maximum rate</i> is a pool of bytes used to fulfill requests during
short periods of traffic higher than your specified <i>average rate</i>, but
still maintains the average over a long period. A low average rate but a high
maximum rate enforces a long-term average while still allowing more traffic
during peak times if the average hasn't been reached lately. If your average
rate is the same as your <i>maximum rate</i>, then Tor will never exceed the
specified rate. Your <i>maximum rate</i> must always be greater than or equal
to your <i>average rate</i>.
</p>
<p>
The <i>average rate</i> is the maximum long-term average bandwidth allowed (in
kilobytes per second). For example, you might want to choose 2 megabytes per 
second (2048 KB/s), or 50 kilobytes per second (a medium-speed cable
connection). Tor requires a minimum of 20 kilobytes per second to run a
relay.
</p>
<p>
It is important to remember that Tor measures bandwidth in <b>bytes</b>, not
bits. Also, Tor only looks at incoming bytes instead of outgoing bytes. For
example, if your relay acts as a directory mirror, you may be sending more
outgoing bytes than incoming. If you find this is the case and is putting too
much strain on your bandwidth, you should consider unchecking the checkbox
labeled <i>Mirror the relay directory</i>.
</p>

<a name="exitpolicy"/>
<h3>Användningspolicyn</h3>
<p>
Exit policies give you a way to specify what kinds of resources on the
Internet you are willing let other Tor users access from your Tor relay. 
Tor uses a default list of exit policies that restrict some services, 
such as mail to prevent spam and some default file sharing ports to reduce 
abuse of the Tor network. 
</p>
<p>
Each of the checkboxes represents a type of resource that you can allow Tor
users to access through your relay. If you uncheck the box next to a
particular type of resource, Tor users will not be allowed to access that
resource from your relay. If the box labeled <i>Misc Other Services</i> 
is checked, Tor users will be able to access other services not
covered by the other checkboxes or Tor's default exit policy.
</p>

<p>
For completeness, the following table lists the specific port numbers
represented by each of the exit policy checkboxes. The <b>Description</b>
column describes the resources Tor clients will be allowed to access through
your relay, if the associated box is checked.
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td><b>Checkbox</b></td>
  <td><b>Ports</b></td>
  <td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Websites</td>
  <td valign="middle">80</td>
  <td>Normal, unencrypted Web browsing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Secure Websites (SSL)</td>
  <td valign="middle">443</td>
  <td>Encrypted Web browsing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Retrieve Mail (POP, IMAP)</td>
  <td valign="middle">110, 143, 993, 995</td>
  <td>Downloading email (does not permit sending email)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Instant Messaging (IM)</td>
  <td valign="middle">703, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 8300, 8888</td>
  <td>Instant messaging applications like MSN Messenger, AIM, ICQ, and Jabber</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</td>
  <td valign="middle">6660-6669, 6697</td>
  <td>IRC clients and servers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Misc. Other Services</td>
  <td valign="middle">*</td>
  <td>All other applications that aren't covered by the previous checkboxes</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
If you do not want to let other Tor users make connections outside the Tor
network from your relay, you can uncheck all of the checkboxes. Even if you
uncheck all of the checkboxes, your relay is still useful to the Tor network.
Your relay will allow other Tor users to connect to the Tor network and will
help relay traffic between other Tor relays.
</p>
<p>
If you chose to run a bridge relay, the <i>Exit Policies</i> tab will be
grayed out, since bridge relays do not allow exit connections.
