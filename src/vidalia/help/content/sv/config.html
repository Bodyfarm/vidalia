<h1>Configuring Vidalia and Tor</h1>
<hr />

<p>
Vidalia allows you to configure some of the most commonly modified aspects of
Vidalia and Tor. It also lets you set up and manage a <a
href="server.html">Tor relay</a> so you can help the Tor network
grow.
</p>

<a name="general"/>
<h3>General Settings</h3>
<p>
Settings on the <i>General</i> page are the most commonly modified settings.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tor Executable</b>: 
    This is the Tor executable that Vidalia will run when you select
    <i>Start</i> from the tray menu. If you have multiple versions of Tor installed,
    you can tell Vidalia which version you would like to run by clicking the
    <i>Browse</i> button and navigating to the particular Tor installation you
    want.
  </li>
  <li><b>Startup Options</b>:
    This setting allows you to have Vidalia automatically start Tor when
    Vidalia starts. You can also configure Vidalia to run when your system
    starts (<i>Windows only</i>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Network Settings</h3>
<p>
The <i>Network</i> settings page lets you change how Tor connects to the Tor
network.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>I use a proxy to access the Internet</b>:
    If your Internet connection requires an HTTP proxy, you can configure Tor
    to send all of its directory requests and Tor relay connections through
    your proxy. You must specify at least the hostname or address of your
    proxy, and the port on which your proxy is listening for connections. If
    your proxy requires authentication, you can also enter the
    <i>Username</i> and <i>Password</i> you use to connect to your proxy.
    Otherwise, you can leave those fields blank.
  </li>
  <li><b>My firewall only lets me connect to certain ports</b>:
    If you are behind a restrictive firewall or proxy that limits the ports you
    are able to connect t
