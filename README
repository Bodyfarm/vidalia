Vidalia is a cross-platform controller GUI for Tor, built using the Qt
framework. Using Vidalia, you can start and stop Tor, view the status of Tor
at a glance, and monitor Tor's bandwidth usage. Vidalia also makes it easy to
contribute to the Tor network by helping you set up and manage your own Tor
server.

Vidalia runs on most platforms supported by Qt 4.2 or later, including
Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux or other Unix variants using the X11 window
system.

Vidalia is written by Matt Edman and Justin Hipple.
