Instruction for Building and Installing Vidalia from Source

   1. Make sure you have CMake, Qt >= 4.1 and Tor >= 0.1.2.18 installed.
   
   2. Run `cmake . && make`.
   
   3. When the previous command finishes, Vidalia's binary will be
      placed in the src/vidalia/ directory. On Mac OS X, the resulting binary
      will be in a Vidalia.app application bundle under src/vidalia/.
   
   4. Optionally, you can run make install to install Vidalia into
      your /usr/local/bin/ directory.
